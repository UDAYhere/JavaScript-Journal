<!-- In JavaScript, callbacks are used for handling operations like reading files and making API requests. When there is excessive nesting of the functions it leads to a problem known as the callback hell. Due to this, it becomes difficult to read the code, debug, and maintain. But when we implement the promises and async/await it helps in improving the code. -->
