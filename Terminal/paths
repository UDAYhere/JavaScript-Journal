-> the paths can be of two types absolute and relative paths 

1. the absoulte path we can write anywhere in any directoryand it starts with a "/" it is the complete path for your desired directory or a folder in your system
ex-"/users/uday/desktop/doc's"

2. the relative path is totaly different and to change the directory here we should make sure that the desired directory should be in our current directory.
ex-"desktop/doc's"

also we have the cocpet of the root directory and the home directory.
let's understand this.
supose you buyed new laptop and windows is installed in that laptop and you have created several accounts there so the accounts that you have created is a home directory and the main is windows that is your root directory.
